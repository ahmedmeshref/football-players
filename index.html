            <h2>Lionel Andrés Messi</h2>
            <p>
                An Argentine international, Messi is his country's all-time leading goalscorer. At youth level, he won
                the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship, finishing the tournament with both the Golden Ball and Golden
                Shoe, and an Olympic gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics. His style of play as a diminutive,
                left-footed dribbler drew comparisons with his compatriot Diego Maradona, who described Messi as his
                successor. After his senior debut in August 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score
                in a FIFA World Cup during the 2006 edition, and reached the final of the 2007 Copa América, where he
                was named young player of the tournament. As the squad's captain from August 2011, he led Argentina to
                three consecutive finals: the 2014 FIFA World Cup, for which he won the Golden Ball, and the 2015 and
                2016 Copas América. After announcing his international retirement in 2016, he reversed his decision and
                led his country to qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, and a third-place finish at the 2019 Copa
                América.

            <h2>CRISTIANO RONALDO</h2>
            <p>
                Born and raised in Madeira, Ronaldo began his senior club career playing for Sporting CP, before
                signing with Manchester United in 2003, aged 18. After winning the FA Cup in his first season, he
                helped United win three successive Premier League titles, the UEFA Champions League, and the FIFA Club
                World Cup; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or. In 2009, Ronaldo was the subject of the then-most
                expensive association football transfer when signed for Real Madrid in a transfer worth €94 million
                (£80 million). There, Ronaldo won 15 trophies, including two La Liga titles, two Copas del Rey, and
                four UEFA Champions League titles, and became the club's all-time top goalscorer. After joining Madrid,
                Ronaldo finished runner-up for the Ballon d'Or three times, behind Lionel Messi—his perceived career
                rival—before winning back-to-back Ballons d'Or from 2013–2014 and again from 2016–2017. After winning
                a third consecutive Champions League title in 2018, Ronaldo became the first player to win the trophy
                five times. In 2018, he signed for Juventus in a transfer worth an initial €100 million (£88 million),
                the highest ever paid by an Italian club and the highest ever paid for a player over 30 years old. He
                won the Serie A in his debut season with the club.

        <div class="landing__container">
            <h2>EDEN HAZARD</h2>
            <p>
                Hazard is the son of two former footballers and began his career in Belgium playing for local youth
                clubs. In 2005, he moved to France, where he began his senior career with Ligue 1 club Lille.
                Hazard spent two years in the club's academy and, at the age of 16, made his professional debut
                in November 2007. He went on to become an integral part of the Lille team under manager Rudi Garcia,
                making over 190 appearances. In his first full season as a starter, he won the Ligue 1 Young Player
                of the Year award, becoming the first non-French player to win the award.[7] In the 2009–10 season,
                Hazard captured the award again, becoming the first player to win the award twice.[8] He was also
                named to the Ligue 1 Team of the Year. In the 2010–11 season, he was a part of the Lille team that
                won the league and cup double and, as a result of his performances, was named the Ligue 1 Player of
                the Year, the youngest player to win the award.[9] Hazard was also given the Bravo Award by Italian
                magazine Guerin Sportivo for his performances during this season.[10]
